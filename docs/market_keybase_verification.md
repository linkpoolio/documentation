Keybase integration provides a way to socially identify users and node operators listed on the Market. This mechanism will protect and give visibility to contract creators to whether the node that theyâ€™re using is operated by who they say they are.

If you have a Team account in the Market, the Team admin must complete the Keybase verification. Link your Keybase and Market accounts:

## Create Keybase Account
To start, create an account at [keybase.io](http://keybase.io) using either their mobile or desktop application. The Keybase username you select does not have to match your handle or name on the Market.

## Add Social Identities
To prove your identity in Keybase, view/edit your profile and select `Add More Identities` from your social media accounts and websites.

## Associating Keybase & Market
There are two ways that you can prove your Market identity with Keybase.

### Keybase App
If you have a Team account in the Market, the Team admin must complete the verification.
- Link your Market account in the Keybase app in the same way social media accounts are verified. Edit your profile, select `Add More Identities`, and search for `market.link`.
- You'll be prompted to enter your handle on the Market. If you have a Team in the Market, you should enter your Team handle, otherwise enter your user handle.
- Next you will be redirected to the market.link domain, and once logged in, you will be able to authorize Keybase, linking your identity.

### Command Line
If you've installed the desktop Keybase client, you can manage your identities from the command line.

- Run the following command:

        keybase prove market.link

- You'll be prompted to enter your handle on the Market. If you have a Team in the Market, you should enter your Team handle, otherwise enter your user handle.
- Copy the generated link to your browser, and once logged in, you will be able to authorize Keybase, linking your identities.

## Changing an Identity
Updating the Market handle that is associated to Keybase can be done in the UI or the command line.

### Keybase App
- Click to view/edit your profile, find the market.link identity and select `revoke`.
- Repeat the process above for verifying a new Market handle.

### Command Line
- Repeat the process above to overwrite your existing Keybase verification by running:

        keybase prove market.link

- When prompted to overwrite your existing proof, select `y` and repeat the process above to verify a new Market handle.
