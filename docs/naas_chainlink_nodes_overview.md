Node as a Service (NaaS) offers the ability to deploy a private, secure Chainlink Node. Chainlink Nodes enable access to the Node Operator GUI used to create and manage jobs for requesting off-chain data. For more information about Chainlink Nodes [visit their documentation](https://docs.chain.link/docs/running-a-chainlink-node/).

## I. Getting Started

Installing a Chainlink Node can be accomplished with just a few steps:

- Navigate to [naas.link/nodes](https://naas.link/nodes)
- Select the Node you'd like to deploy 
- Specify a name and region
- Deploy the Node

The Node will be available within a few moments. Once the Node is live, you will be able to login to the Operator GUI with the credentials provided upon deployment. 

## II. Networks

NaaS is currently available to the following testnets. In the Spring of 2022, LinkPool will release Mainnet support for the same blockchain protocols:

- Ethereum (Rinkeby, Goerli, Kovan)
- Optimism (Kovan)
- Binance (Testnet)
- HECO (Testnet)
- Matic (Testnet)
- Avalanche (Testnet)
- Arbitrum (Testnet)

## III. Expiration

Testnet nodes have an expiration period of 30 days. Nodes may be renewed with 2 days of expiration. Nodes that are not renewed will be automatically be destroyed upon expiration.

## IV. Limitations

Each user may deploy one testnet node.

## V. Pricing

Nodes are currently free to use in Testnets (subject to change).
